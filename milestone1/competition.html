        <h2>What Food Websites are Doing Right</h2>
        <p>Based on the website, "www.who.int", they are putting necessary information onto the website <br> 
        to help readers get basic information on what to eat/what not to eat. <br>
    There are a lot of quotes and journal articles represented on the website. </p>
        <h2> What Food Websites are Doing Wrong</h2>
        <p> The website is not allowing people to view any products or food items to purchase. <br>
        There are no ads on the website allowing businesses to market food.</p>
        <h2> How can my website do it better?</h2>
        <p> My website can allow people to market products, read information about food/nutrition, and 
            allow readers to focus on certain foods to include in their daily lives.
